Dream_Description,Interpretation
Scholarly Differences on the Nafs,"It should be noted that the scholars differed greatly concerning the meaning of the Nafs [soul or self]. My Shaykh, Shihaab-ud-Deen Al-Quraafi, narrated to me from Imam Taqiy-ud-Deen Ibn Daqeeq Al-Eid that he saw a book by the wise men about the reality of the Nafs in which there were 300 definitions. He (Peace be upon him) said: The fact that there is such a difference of opinion is indicative of the large number of possibilities."
Views on Discussion of the Nafs,"Moreover, the scholars of Islam differed as to whether it is permissible to indulge in discussion of this matter or not, and there are two views: The evidence of those who say that it is not allowed is the Verse in which Allah says: 'And they ask you (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) concerning the Rooh (the spirit). Say: Ã¢ÂÂThe Rooh (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.Ã¢ÂÂ[Al-IsraÃ¢ÂÂ 17:85] The relevant point here is that Allah did not explain the Nafs to His Prophet (Peace be upon him) in this Verse; rather the answer given here is general and brief: Ã¢ÂÂSay: Ã¢ÂÂThe Rooh (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord.Ã¢ÂÂ Allah explains that people were given only a little of knowledge, and that implies that knowledge of the soul is among the abundant knowledge that is known only to Allah. Whatever Allah has concealed knowledge of, how can we indulge in discussing it?"
Permissibility of Discussion,"The second opinion is that of those who say that it is permissible, and they say that Allah only forbade engaging in discussion thereof with people other than scholars. This view was favoured by Imam Al-Ghazali. But then those who said that it is permissible differed: is the Nafs a quality that resulted from the way things are put together as the coherent images, amazing threads and brilliant patterns appear in a garment of silk, then if the fabric disintegrates the image disappears and does not remain? Or does it have an essence or substance? Or does it have no essence and no quality? And is it that it cannot be described as being inside or outside the body? This is the view of Al-Ghazali and others."
Later Scholars' View,"The view of later scholars is that the Nafs is a substance made of light, like a flame going through the body, and like the sap in the rose and the heat of fire in the meat. The evidence that it is in the body is the Verse in which Allah says: Ã¢ÂÂThen why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat?Ã¢ÂÂ[Al-WaaqiÃ¢ÂÂah 56:83] If it were not in the body, then Allah would not have said that: If you tell me that Galen said: We dissected a body and we did not find any trace of the soul; moreover if it was in the body that would mean that if a limb were cut off, part of the soul would be cut off too, but that is not the case so the soul is not there. I would say: Not finding something does not mean that it does not exist, based on the case of glass, which is extracted from sand after subjecting it to some processes. If we check the sand, we will not find any trace of glass. Moreover, transparent bodies cannot be seen, based on the case of the air around us. Furthermore, the soul may retract or extend, so perhaps it retracts when a limb is cut off, so cutting off a limb does not necessarily mean cutting off part of the Nafs. Moreover it may be divided into parts and then put together again, as indicated by the story of Shaykh AbuÃ¢ÂÂl-Zaahir. Whatever is like that cannot be cut off, as attested by the case of water, fire and clouds."
Synonyms for the Soul,"It should be noted that the soul, spirit, heart and mind are synonymous and can only refer to one thing in the body. It is called the soul (Nafs) because it is inclined towards whims and desires; it is called the spirit (Rooh) because the body cannot be alive or function without it; it is called the heart (Qalb) because it is constantly changing (Taqallub); and it is called the mind (Ã¢ÂÂAql) because it understands information and the mind is knowledge."
Purpose of the Nafs and Senses,"Once this is understood, you should know that Allah only created this body so that through the Nafs a person may acquire divine knowledge which is the cause of eternal happiness. Allah also created these five senses, namely hearing, sight, smell, taste and touch, and in the brain there are five other senses, namely rational sense, the ability to process real images, imagination, comprehension and memory. There is a difference of opinion concerning these senses: are they like windows through which the Nafs looks and learns what is beyond them, or are they like spies and servants, as in a pavilion in which a king is sitting in the middle, and in the pavilion there are five windows, behind each of which is a spy telling what he sees?"
Role of Imagination and Memory,"He acquires knowledge so that he can take care of the interests of the people under his charge, so he is always working to manage the affairs of his people and seeing how best to serve their interests. But then that king cannot continue working in that manner; rather he needs to rest, so he and his servants rest. But whilst resting he cannot neglect his peopleÃ¢ÂÂs affairs, so it is essential that he ask someone to keep a record of what happens whilst he is resting, so that he can tell him about that when he comes back to his headquarters. So Allah has put this Nafs in the body like that king in his pavilion, and He has made sleep a means for the soul to rest from its work. And He has given it the power of imagination, which is like a smooth mirror, and the Nafs is also like a heavy mirror: when it stands before Al-Lawh Al-Mahfooz, it imprints on it what Allah wants it to know. If that is imprinted on the Nafs, it will have a specific impact on the imagination, so that he can envisage it. Then Allah makes it possible for the memory to memorise what is envisaged by the imagination, and He enables another power to transfer what the memory has memorized to the Nafs when the veil of sleep is lifted from it."
Imam Fakhr-ud-Deen Al-Khateeb's View,"Imam Fakhr-ud-Deen Al-Khateeb said: It is proven that Allah has created the Nafs in such a way that it is able to ascend to heaven and to read Al-Lawh Al-Mahfooz, but that is not possible when a person is awake, because then the Nafs is preoccupied with managing the physical affairs of the individual. But at the time of sleep, it becomes less distracted so it is able to learn things. So once it finds out some information that has an appropriate impact on the imagination, so the Nafs learns things from that impact."
Example of Dreams and Their Interpretation,"Shaykh Shihaab ibn NiÃ¢ÂÂmah said: An example of that is if a man sees himself in a dream eating sweets from a nice dish, then when he awakens, if the dreamer is sick with a fever, we say that (the dream) indicates that his sickness will be lengthy, and if he is healthy, then if the dreamer is a king we say that he is going to take over some land, and if he is of lower status, then he will be promoted to a good position; if he is a seeker of knowledge he will gain more knowledge, and if he is a single man, he will marry a beautiful wife. But if the sweets are of bad quality or rotten, all of that is reversed. It should be noted that some souls are very strong, so they see dreams which turn out exactly as seen. There are some people who, if their thoughts wander, they see in those wandering thoughts things like others see in dreams; sometimes it has an interpretation but sometimes there is no interpretation. I have seen that in myself and others."
Definition of Dreams,"Dreams are a kind of knowledge that one may learn when sleeping, by means of interpreting symbols in most cases. Imam Al-Ghazali said: Souls cannot be seen, and what is seen in dreams is only symbols which indicate a meaning to the dreamer. This is supported by the fact that a man may sleep during the day and see (in his dream) someone he knows and some interaction may take place between them, but at that time the other man is not sleeping. So it is not possible to say that his soul came out so that the dreamer could see it; rather it is no more than a symbol of him."
Exception to General Rule,"We say usually because there may be an exception to what we have mentioned. A man may see something in his dream and then see the exact same thing in reality. One of the Companions saw in his dream Thaabit ibn Shammaas, who had been killed in the war with Musaylimah. Thaabit said to him: I will give you my will and last requests; beware of saying that this is just a dream and neglecting it. When I was killed yesterday, a Muslim man came past me and took my shield. His tent is on the furthest edge of the camp, and there is a horse next to his tent. He has thrown a pot over the shield, and on top of the pot he has put a saddle. Go to Khaalid ibn Al-Waleed and tell him to send someone to take my shield, then when you reach Madeenah, go to the caliph of the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) and tell him that I owe such and such to so-and-so, and that so-and-so among my slaves are free. The man went to Khaalid and told him about that, and he sent someone to bring the shield to him. Then he told Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) about the dream, and he approved of ThaabitÃ¢ÂÂs will after his death. It is not known that any manÃ¢ÂÂs will was approved after his death except the will of Thaabit."
Types of Dreams - Sound vs Meaningless,"Dreams may be classified on the basis of five criteria: A. Whether they are sound or meaningless. 1. Sound dreams are those in which things are seen as they are seen when one is awake. 2. Meaningless dreams are those which stem from one of five things: Self-talk, Habits, Fear, Imagination and envisaging things, When one of the humours predominates."
Self-talk,"Self-talk: which results in seeing themes that are meaningless, i.e., what a person thinks about to himself, because when a person is thinking to himself about something, that thing appears in his imagination, especially when the thing is dear to the Nafs. So when he goes to sleep, his imagination envisages it, then his memory stores it and that image reaches the Nafs when the veil of sleeping is lifted."
Habbits,"Habits, which result in a person seeing himself doing what he usually does. So a Muezzin sees himself giving the Adhaan, a reader sees himself reading, and a person who usually rides horses sees himself riding a horse and so on. This is not of any significance. But if he sees himself doing an action that is lower or better than his usual action, such as if he usually rides an old nag and he sees himself riding a fine steed, or vice versa, and the like, then this is significant and may be interpreted."
Fear,"Fear, which results in a man seeing something that indicates that a thing feared by people may happen. This is of no significance."
Imagination and Envisaging Things,"Imagination and envisaging things. If there is something in the dream that he imagined or envisaged, it is of no significance, such as if a man says, I saw myself riding the mule of Ã¢ÂÂAbd Al-Haqq ibn Sulaymaan, and it was as if I were between darkness and light. I said: Did you imagine yourself riding? He said: Yes. I said: You want what he has, and this dream is of no significance."
Predominance of Humours,"When one of the humours predominates, such as if the blood predominates, a person will see (in his dream) things that bring joy and entertainment; if yellow bile predominates, he will see yellow things, fire and smoke; if phlegm predominates, he will see rain and snow; if black bile predominates, he will see black things. This is of no significance."
Interpretation of Corrupt Dreams,"Shihaab ibn NiÃ¢ÂÂmah said: If he sees along with something corrupt a thing that is not corrupt, then disregard the corrupt thing and interpret the rest."
Types of Dreams - Good or Evil,"3. Whether they are good or evil: a) That which is indicative of good both explicitly and implicitly, such as drinking milk or wearing fine clothes in the case of one for whom it is appropriate to wear them. This is good as it appears to be, and it may be understood as referring implicitly to provision and benefits. b) The opposite of that, such as burning with fire, drinking poison or being bitten by a snake. This indicates harm from an enemy both explicitly and implicitly. c) That which appears outwardly to be bad, but in fact implies something good, such as death and being carried on the bier and crucifixion, unless the position is reversed or the Ã¢ÂÂAwrah is uncovered. This implies a rise in status, although it is outwardly bad. d) That which is apparently good but implies something bad. Shihaab ibn NiÃ¢ÂÂmah said: Such as smelling a flower, if the person says Ã¢ÂÂahÃ¢ÂÂ after smelling it, which is a word that is usually said at times of hardship. Other scholars disagreed with that, which will be discussed below. Arees said: I dreamt that I was smelling rosewater, and I said this is a calamity that will result from a white animal. He had a white mare which died, and he was distressed as a result. The correct view in my opinion is that smelling fragrances is indicative of joy and happiness which will be followed by some distress or hardship, because Shihaab ibn NiÃ¢ÂÂmah said: Thus we may reconcile both views."
Types of Dreams - Closeness or Distance,"4. Whether they show a thing as being near or far. a) Indications of closeness, which is a sign of calamity or distress. By His grace, Allah does not combine two kinds of distress for His slave: the distress of expecting calamity and distress when it occurs. If a man sees (in his dream) something that may cause distress, then ask him: if it has already happened then it may be interpreted as such, otherwise it means that it is close at hand. Similarly, what indicates something good, if it is seen during the day, then it most likely indicates that it is going to materialize soon, and that also applies if something appears in the dream that indicates that it is going to be soon, such as the dream of the servant (who was in prison with Yoosuf (May Allah be pleased with him): because he saw himself in a garden, at the bottom of a strong grapevine that had three branches on which there were three bunches of grapes, and he saw himself collecting them and squeezing them into the cup of the King and giving it to him to drink. Yoosuf (May Allah be pleased with him) said: As for being at the bottom of the grapevine, that is a good sign and indicates that you will come out of prison after three and will go back as you were. So he regarded the three branches as a sign of closeness or that this event was going to happen soon. b) Indication that something is far off and it is impossible for it to happen soon, such as the dream of Abu Bakr which told of power and authority, because the means of power and authority were not available at that time. c) Indication that something is coming soon or that is far off, and that is something other than this. It may be said that if one goes to sleep at the beginning of the night and sees a dream, it is going to happen later, and if it is seen nearer to morning, then it is going to happen soon, and if it is seen in the middle of the night then it is in between being close at hand and far off. What I have experienced is different from that; a dream may be seen at the beginning of the night and materializes the next morning, or it may be seen at the end of the night and take a long time to materialize."
Types of Dreams - Earning a Livelihood,"5. With regard to how easy or difficult it is to earn a livelihood. a) That in which provision is easy at the beginning and at the end, such as drinking milk or honey, or eating butter and loaves of bread and so on. b) That which is difficult at the beginning and at the end, and easy in the middle, such as the citron which has a skin that has a sharp taste, then in the middle is the pulp, which is sweet, then the last part is worthless. The same applies to the pomegranate: the skin is tough, in the middle is the pulp which is sweet, and the end is hard. Shaykh Shihaab-ud-Deen noted this meaning when he interpreted the dream for a man who dreamt that he had a bone in which there was marrow and on which there was meat, and he was eating that meat and marrow. He told him: At the beginning of your life you will be rich, then you will become poor, then you will become rich again, because the meat is wealth and the marrow is wealth, and the bone, on which there is nothing, is in the middle and comes in between them. And it turned out as he said. c) That which is difficult in the beginning and easy at the end, like almonds; at the beginning there is the shell which represents hardship, or it may refer to some income, the means of acquiring which starts with a dispute, because the shell makes a sound when you break it, and the centre of the almond is at the end. d) That which is the opposite of that, such as dates and raisins, because the beginning thereof is the pulp and the end is the pit or hard seed. Shaykh Shihaab-ud-Deen said: Rather apricots and peaches are indicative of hardship, because they contain a pit and the eater is worried about it lest it damage his teeth."
"Types of Dreams - One Dream, Many Meanings","6. With regard to cases where various dreams mean one thing or one dream has various meanings. It should be noted that dreams may vary but have one meaning, or there may be the same dream but it has different meanings. An example of the first is where the judge sees in a dream that his mule dies, or he loses his pen, or his ink pot is broken or lost, or he loses his ring or chair, or he sees himself separating from his wife, or his shoes get damaged or he sells them or they wear out totally or partially. All of that indicates that he will be dismissed. Similarly, if one person sees the sun eclipsed, and another sees the ocean dry up, and another sees a great mountain collapse, and another sees a great river disappearing into the earth: all of that is indicative of one thing, which is the death of a great man, whether he is one of the righteous, a scholar, or a ruler."
"Types of Dreams - One Thing, Many Meanings","With regard to one thing meaning many things, there are five causes of that: a) Differences in language, as in the case of the Safarjal or quince. In the Persian language the word Safarjal means glory, so if a Persian or someone who knows their language sees it in his dream, in his case it refers to glory and pride. For the Arabs and those who know their language, Safarjal means a bone, and is indicative of travelling for Jihad or Hajj. If you misspell or mispronounce it, so that the Jeem becomes haÃ¢ÂÂ, then you are saying Safar Hall, which means it is time to travel. So if you say I saw a Safarjal, this is indicative of travel (Safar) and departure (JalaÃ¢ÂÂ). This is supported by the words of the poet: b) Do not give a Safarjal to the one you love, for the beginning of it is Safar (travel) and the end of it is departure (Jala). c) In my view, for the one who is distressed it signals relief because it may be mispronounced to say Baththun Yufraj (distress will be relieved). d) Differences of religion, such as eating dead meat or drinking alcohol. For the one who believes them to be Haraam, (seeing them in a dream) means that he will get Haraam wealth, otherwise it will be permissible wealth. e) Differences in customs, such as taking off oneÃ¢ÂÂs clothes. If that is done in the bath, it represents something good and relief from distress, because it is the normal thing to do; but (if a person sees himself in his dream) taking off his clothes in front of a gathering of people, this is indicative of a bad reputation, especially if he is exposing the Ã¢ÂÂAwrah. The same applies to shaving the beard; it represents something good for those who prefer that, such as the Christians and the Qarandaliyyah, and for those who adorn themselves to attract women and the one who prefers an easy life. Similarly wearing silk and gold for the one for whom it is suitable is indicative of something good and coming closer to the prominent people. If a deceased person is seen with silk and gold, then that indicates that he is in a good state. f) Differences in season, such as seeing oneself in a dream getting close to the fire for warmth, seeking the warmth of the sun, wearing fur or using hot water in the winter; this is good and is indicative of recovery for one who is sick because of the cold. But in the summer it is indicative of distress and misfortune and of lengthy sickness for one who is sick because of heat. Similarly a tree is a good sign at times of ease, and the shade of a tree is also a good sign at times when it is hot, but it is indicative of distress and little benefit at times of hardship. g) Differences between people. Carrying a weapon (in the dream) for an off-duty soldier means that he will be called to service, for the fighter it is indicative of victory, for the worshipper it is a signal that he will give up his worship, for the student it is a sign that he will give up his study, and for others it is a warning of a bad deal with their opponents. Wearing a fine white garment (in a dream) is good for Fuqaha and the righteous, as it is indicative of a rise in status, a good attitude and a good life. But for butchers and herders it is a bad thing, as it indicates that they will lose their livelihood because they wear that when they are not working; but wearing dirty clothing is a good sign for them, because it is indicative of how they earn their livelihood, whereas for the Fuqaha and the righteous it is a bad thing. Riding a mule (in a dream) for the Faqeeh indicates that he will be appointed to some position; for the one who wants to get married it indicates that he will find a wife; for the cook and those in similar professions, it is indicative of a bad reputation. For a king, a pomegranate indicates a city; for the Faqeeh it indicates appointment to some position; for the provision seeker it indicates provision; for the one who is single it indicates a spouse; for the traveller it indicates capital, and it indicates the same for the one who wants to buy a house. Rain (in a dream) represents provision and plenty of it, but it indicates a lack of provision for the fuller; the opposite is the case with regard to the sun. Eating sweets (in a dream) represents provision for the healthy and recovery for the sick whose sickness is due to cold, whereas for those whose sickness is due to heat it indicates that their sickness will last for a long time; sour things represent the opposite of that."

"Etiquette for the dreamer includes not telling the dream to those who may envy, the ignorant, the sick, children, or women",Dreams should not be told to those who might misinterpret them or who lack understanding.
